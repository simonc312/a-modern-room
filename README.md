Text based game inspired by a Firelit Room

With code forked from To-do modular app by Addyosmani, A Modern Room is a simplistic text based game made using backbone.js for models and views and collections, require.js for modularity, sinatra for url routing, and HTML5 LocalStorage for local storage. 
Enjoy!
